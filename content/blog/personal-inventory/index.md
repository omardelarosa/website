## Personal Inventory

The three things that would be in my personal inventory are listed below:

### 1. `git`

This deceptively complex CLI solves a very complicated problem (version control) in an extremely elegant way (a three letter CLI `git` with an entire world of features). Why is it in my personal inventory? Because I use it every day in my work and in my personal programming projects and I really can't imagine doing much of my craft of programming without it.

### 2. SNES Controller

The SNES (Super Nintendo Entertainment System) was not the first video game console I played, but it was the first one I had of my own. When I was 8 years old, my grandfather passed away. Perhaps as a way of coping and maybe getting her mind off the situation that her husband had died, my grandmother bought me an SNES at Toys R Us against my mom's wishes (she didn't think I was old enough to play video games and they would be a bad influence on me). Eventually, my mom accepted video games in the house. She even came to believe that the text-heavy JRPGs like [Chrono Trigger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrono_Trigger) and [Secret Of Mana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_of_Mana) that I primarily played somehow served as "reading practice" (if only she knew how bad those US localizations were.)

### 3. Roland Juno 106

This seemingly hunk-of-junk keyboard was my first real synthesizer. I bought this on eBay as a freshman in college and it opened up a world of D.I.Y. music production and experimenting with sound synthesis. I subsequently bought other keyboards and instruments, but perhaps this was the one I remember the most fondly as a "gateway synth".
