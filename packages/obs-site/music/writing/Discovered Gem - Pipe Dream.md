My primary mode of listening to music these days is [Spotify's Discovered Weekly](https://www.spotify.com/us/discoverweekly/). Although I've historically prefered "manually curated" music recommendation ala [Pitchfork](https://www.pitchfork.com), [Noisey](https://noisey.vice.com), [Brooklyn Vegan](http://www.brooklynvegan.com), etc., I haven't had as much time as I used to for reading those sites.

Anyway, this will be the first of my _Discovered Gems_ post that attempts to keep track of greak music I've discovered via programmatic playlists (ala Discover Weekly). The first song I care to share in this vain is:

### "Pipe Dream" by Kyle Duke & The Brown Bag Boys

As a great, woozy, hazy, quasi-lo-fi rock track, it's right up the alley of anyone who loves Real Estate or Mac DeMarco (like this guy). The lyrics are also circular, simple and sparse. A song that tries without trying.
