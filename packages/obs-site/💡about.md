## who am i?

I am not always sure how to describe myself, since I dabble in many domains.  I hate the "master of none" cliche, since I like to think I'm pretty good at a few of them like [[_music]] and maybe [[_magic the gathering]].

Anyway, to be reductionist <mark>I'm a former public school teacher, turned software engineer who likes to make things in his spare time.</mark> I am from the sunshine state of FL, but I've lived in NYC since 2010.  I love to take walks around the city and tinker with gadgets and doodle when I'm not working my 9 to 5 job.

I also play a fair amount of [[_magic the gathering]] and my favorite format is Modern, but I am known to play Commander/EDH once in a while.  My username on MTGO and most things Magic is `nabitsco`.

## what is this site all about?

I have this website as a way to stay active with my writing, which I enjoy as a way to organize my thoughts and document ideas.  It's also a way to share my process with others.
