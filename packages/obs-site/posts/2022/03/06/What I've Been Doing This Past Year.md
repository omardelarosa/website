It's been a really long time since I posted here.  *Too* long if you ask me.  Anyway, in addition to correcting some typos and adding a link to my RL Brush tech talk last year based [on my paper on it](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02778), I added some updates to my projects section.  Most notably, I added a link to [a great blog post my co-worker wrote about ML Home](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2022/01/product-lessons-from-ml-home-spotifys-one-stop-shop-for-machine-learning/), which what I've been working on this past year (or rather from 2021 to the present) at Spotify.

ML Home is part of our installation of [Backstage](https://backstage.io/) and looks a bit like this:

It's a dashboard linking up a number of interconnected services.  Anyway, read the blog post.  It's great.
